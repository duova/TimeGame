/**This class is an extension of UItemTrait and is meant to be
 * associated with an item component to handle logic tied to an item.
 * This has several benefits, but is more expensive.
 * 1. The item Component will be viable for replication.
 * 2. Instanced UObjects are known to be very buggy whenever you try and
 * modify the data inside of them. Since these methods construct a whole new
 * item component, we can get around that buggy behavior.
 * 3. Timers, delays, animations, async tasks and RPC's will work.
 *
 * You can continue to run basic functions inside this object, but they should always be
 * instant and not modify the variables living on this object.

	/**@Both Item Component will get constructed on the server and replicated to the client.

	 * method you'll be using.
	 * 
	 *@Server Item Component will only exist on the server. Only the server is allowed
	 * to construct this Component. This is the safest method but biggest nuisance
	 * to execute.
	 *
	 * @Client Item Component will only exist on clients, replication will not happen
	 * unless the client is the listen server. This is the least secure and will
	 * work virtually every time.
	 *
	 * For single player games, none of these options will change their behavior. They
	 * will all work, but it is recommended to keep them set to @Both in case you ever
